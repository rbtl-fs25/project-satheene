  abstract = {The research aimed to examine the relationship between attitude, behavioral control, moral obligation, and inconvenience regarding recycling behavior among students attending public universities in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. A total of 400 participants were chosen from three public universities in the Klang Valley, and data was collected through questionnaires. The study's findings indicate that the majority of respondents hold a moderately positive attitude toward recycling behavior, possess a low sense of perceived behavioral control, feel a lesser moral obligation toward recycling behavior, view recycling behavior as inconvenient, and exhibit a low level of engagement in recycling behavior. The results also reveal that perceived behavioral control and inconvenience have a significant association with recycling behavior. Furthermore, the regression analysis demonstrates that perceived behavioral control and inconvenience exhibit significant relationships with recycling behavior, with perceived behavioral control exerting the greatest influence on recycling behavior. Both of these factors underline the importance of designing and implementig recycling systems that are accessible, easy to use, and well-explained. Doing so can increase perceived behavioral control and decrease the sense of inconvenience, thereby promoting more consistent and widespread recycling behaviors. Recycling is fundamentally important for environmental sustainability as it conserves natural resources, reduces pollution from waste, decreases the demand for raw materials, and mitigates the negative impacts of disposal, contributing significantly to the preservation of our planet for future generations.},

  abstract = {The current dropout rate in physics studies in Germany is about 60{\textbackslash}\%, with the majority of dropouts occurring in the first year. Consequently, the physics study entry phase poses a significant challenge for many students. Students' stress perceptions can provide more profound insights into the processes and challenges during that period. In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points involving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated students' stress perceptions with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified underlying sources of stress, and assessed self-estimated workloads across two different cohorts. This examination occurred almost every week during the first semester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of 3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent stress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by significant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from \$M=20.1, SD=15.9\$ to \$M=63.6, SD=13.4\$ on a scale from 0 to 100. Stress levels rise in the first weeks of the lecture, followed by stable, elevated stress levels until the exams and a relaxation phase afterward during the lecture-free time and Christmas vacation. In the first half of the lecture period, students primarily indicated the weekly exercise sheets, the physics lab course, and math courses as stressors; later on, preparation for exams and the exams themselves emerged as the most important stressors. Together with the students' self-estimated workloads that correlate with the PSQ scores, we can create a coherent picture of stress perceptions among first-year physics students, which builds the basis for supportive measures and interventions.},

  abstract = {Purpose To explore the effects of ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies (eg, green emotions, social norms) and ``soft'' economic incentive policies (eg, high-intensity subsidies, low-intensity subsidies) and their combinations on the public's green product purchasing behavior. Participants and Methods An online questionnaire experiment was conducted on Chinese users using Credamo online questionnaire platform to explore the effects of different ``soft'' intervention policies on consumers' green purchasing behavior, and the sample data were examined using multiple regression. In Study 1, a total of 460 valid samples were collected to explore the differences in the effects of single intervention policies; in Study 2, a total of 556 valid samples were collected to explore the effects of a combination of soft policies. Results In the area of green product purchasing, both behavioral interventions and economic incentives alone can promote green consumption behavior; economic incentives have a more positive impact on guiding consumers to green consumption; the combination of ``soft'' behavioral interventions and ``soft'' economic incentives has a positive impact on green consumption. The combination of ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies and ``soft'' economic incentive policies is more effective than the individual policies. Conclusion The experimental results of Study 1 show that the policy effects of both behavioral intervention policies and economic incentive intervention policies are evident for goods with different value attributes. Meanwhile, comparing the two types of soft intervention policies, we find that the effect of economic incentive intervention policies is stronger than that of soft behavioral intervention policies. In Study 2, the empirical analysis of the policy mix shows that the policy mix is more effective. The combination of ``soft'' economic incentive policies and ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies can effectively increase the salience of policy instruments, and the effect of policy combinations is greater than that of single policies.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that 2.5â€“10 bn disposable coffee cups are used every year in the U.K. Most of these cups end up in landfill or as litter, as the majority of poly-coated paper cups are not recyclable or not recycled. Here, we report on a field experiment that was conducted at twelve university and business sites to examine whether the use of reusable cups can be promoted through easily implementable measures. The study found that both environmental messaging and the provision of alternatives increased the use of reusable cups. While a charge on disposable cups increased their use as well, a discount on reusable cups did not. The effects for the individual measures were modest, but additive, meaning that the greatest behavioural change was achieved with a combination of measures. None of the measures negatively impacted the total number of hot drink sales. One university continued with the charge after the experiment had finished and distributed more reusable cups for free among their students. This boosted the use of reusable cups up to 33.7\% across three cafÃ©s. This shows that a charge in combination with the provision of alternatives can increase the use of reusable cups substantially in the long term.},
